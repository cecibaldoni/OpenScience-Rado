## Abstract
"What do you think when you hear "Open Science"? Is it just a trending buzzword, something that doesn’t apply to you, or something you’re curious or passionate about? Open Science is often reduced to Open Access, but it’s much more than that. It’s about making research more transparent, reliable, and reusable, not just for others but also for your future self. However, many of us hesitate to engage with Open Science, whether due to time constraints, a lack of incentives, or the belief that we’re already doing "the best science" without it. This talk will introduce Open Science beyond the usual clichés, addressing why it matters, its practical benefits, and how we can navigate its challenges. More importantly, I’d like to use this as a starting point for an ongoing conversation in our department: to discuss what Open Science means for us, and how we can collectively move forward."
